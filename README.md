# Youtube-clone
Hello everyone. Today, I created this YouTube clone using HTML and pure CSS, without any framework. I chose this approach because I aim to fully understand the intricacies and beauty of CSS before delving into frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind. By mastering CSS first, I'll be better equipped to comprehend what occurs behind the scenes within these frameworks. In this YouTube clone, I incorporated various features such as grid, flexbox, and position properties, including static, fixed, absolute, and relative positioning. Additionally, I utilized media queries to ensure optimal screen sizing across different devices. Moreover, I employed intermediate CSS properties like opacity and transitions, along with event handling for hover effects. I hope you enjoy it. Thank you.
